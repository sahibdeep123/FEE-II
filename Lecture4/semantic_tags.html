            Kalki (Sanskrit: कल्कि), also called Kalkin,[1] is the prophesied tenth and final incarnation of the god
            Vishnu. He is described to appear in order to end the Kali Yuga, one of the four periods in the endless
            cycle of existence (Krita) in Vaishnava cosmology. The end of the Kali Yuga states this will usher in the
            new epoch of Satya Yuga in the cycle of existence, until the Mahapralaya (dissolution of the
            universe).[1][2]
            Kalki is described in the Puranas as the avatar who rejuvenates existence by ending the darkest and
            destructive period to remove adharma (unrighteousness) and ushering in the Satya Yuga, while riding a white
            horse with a fiery sword.[2] The description and details of Kalki are different among various Puranas. Kalki
            is also found in Buddhist texts, for example the Kalachakra-Tantra of Tibetan Buddhism.[11][12][13]
            The prophecy of the Kalki avatara is also told in Sikh texts.[14]
